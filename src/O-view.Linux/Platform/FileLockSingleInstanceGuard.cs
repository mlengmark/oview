/// Because its lifetime is not tied to the process. Named mutexes on Unix are backed by files
/// in a shared-memory directory, and a hard-killed process (<c>kill -9</c>) can leave the
/// name held — which for an app meant to run for days means "O-view won't start any more,"
/// with a cause the user has no way to guess. An advisory file lock is released by the
/// kernel however the process dies.</para>
///
/// <para>The lock lives in <c>$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR</c> where one exists: it is per-user,
/// per-session, and cleared on logout, matching <see cref="ISingleInstanceGuard"/>'s "one per
/// user session" contract. Falling back to the temp directory keeps it working where that
/// variable is unset.</para>
///
/// <para>This is ordinary file IO — no P/Invoke, no Linux-only API — so it is exercised by
/// this project's own test suite wherever <c>dotnet test</c> runs. That does not confirm the

/// runner for (ADR-0002/0004's "never observed" caveat).</para>
